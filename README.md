# A ToDo list web app with long-term goals too!

## cs50-2018-x-project

done&done helps you stay organized with keeping maintaining your current check list, without letting you lose focus from your long term aspirations. 

The project is available to view and use on https://doneanddone.herokuapp.com.

DISCLAIMER: The `helpers.py` and `layout.html` files, and `login()` and `logout()` methods of `application.py` were used from a previous project and provided by cs50 (pset 7 - Finance).
