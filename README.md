Link to cs50 final prompt - https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/project/project.html
Made as a final project for HarvardX CS50, done&done aims to help you stay organized with keeping maintaining your current check list, without letting you lose focus from your long term aspirations. 

DISCLAIMER: The `helpers.py` and `layout.html` files, and `login()` and `logout()` methods of `application.py` were used from a previous project and provided by cs50 (pset 7 - Finance).
